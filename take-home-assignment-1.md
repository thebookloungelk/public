### **📝 Take-Home Assignment**

Bring up a WordPress website on your local machine using **Docker** 🐳.

**✅ Requirements (try your best):**

1. Use **Docker (with `docker-compose`)** to run WordPress + database ⚡.
2. Make the site accessible at **[https://localhost](https://localhost)** 🔒.
3. Use a **reverse proxy** (e.g., NGINX or Traefik) with a **self-signed certificate** for HTTPS 🌐.
4. Log-in to **[https://localhost/wp-admin](https://localhost/wp-admin)** 🔑, edit the **home page** 🏠, and use your **creative eye 🎨** to design and add a **creative banner** (for example, using Canva and AI ✨).
5. During the interview, be ready to show us:

   * ⚙️ How you set it up
   * 🔐 How you handled HTTPS (self-signed cert)
   * 🖼️ How you customized the home page with your banner
   * 🛠️ Any issues you faced and how you solved them

**📦 Deliverable:**

* A **public GitHub repository** 🌍 containing:

  * `docker-compose.yml`
  * Any config files (e.g., `nginx.conf`, cert generation script if used)
  * A **README.md** 📖 with:

    * 🏗️ Setup instructions (how to run locally)
    * 🐞 Common issues + how you solved them

**🎯 Result:**
